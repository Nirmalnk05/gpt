few hours in advance and predicting potential failures few days ahead. 
This system aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and operational efficiency of our fleet of boats by leveraging cutting-edge technologies in data analytics, machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT).

i) The Existing State of Knowledge or Technology at the Start of the R&D Project
At the inception of this R&D project, the current state of knowledge and technology in the field of predictive maintenance for marine vessels includes:

Scientific or Technical Challenges and Their Complexity

Data Imbalance and Scarcity
Challenge: Actual failure events are rare, resulting in highly imbalanced datasets where the number of normal operating instances vastly outnumbers failure instances.
Complexity: Traditional machine learning models struggle with imbalanced data, leading to biased predictions that favor the majority class (normal operations). Addressing this requires advanced techniques like synthetic data generation, anomaly detection algorithms, and the use of generative models to create realistic failure scenarios.
Reason Not Readily Solvable: A competent professional at the start of the project would need to spend significant time researching and developing novel methods for data augmentation and balancing to ensure the model does not overfit to the majority class, which is a non-trivial task requiring specialized knowledge and innovation.

Feature Extraction and Engineering
Challenge: Extracting meaningful features from 200+ features of high-dimensional, heterogeneous sensor data collected from various systems onboard a vessel.
Complexity: This involves dealing with noise, missing data, and the need for temporal alignment of data streams. Advanced signal processing techniques and domain-specific knowledge are required to transform raw sensor data into features that can be used effectively by predictive models.
Reason Not Readily Solvable: initially 200+ features and need to choose the right features without lossing actual information from sensor data.
Developing an automated and efficient feature extraction pipeline is complex and requires deep expertise in both the domain (maritime operations) and in data science methodologies. This is beyond the capability of a generalist data scientist without specialized R&D efforts.

Advanced Algorithms
Challenge: Designing and training deep learning models that can handle high-dimensional time-series data while avoiding overfitting due to the scarcity of failure events with hih precision and high recall scores.
Complexity: It involves selecting appropriate neural network architectures, such as Auto Encoder deep learning models, that can capture temporal dependencies in the data. Additionally, these models must be robust to noise and capable of generalizing from a limited number of failure instances.
Reason Not Readily Solvable: Statistical & supervised Machine learning doesnt work well.So, need to go for unsupervised deep learning appraoch. A competent professional would need to implement mechanisms for continuous learning and model updating to handle evolving data patterns. This involves setting up robust data pipelines, online learning techniques, and model retraining strategies, which are complex and resource-intensive tasks. It involves iterative experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, and possibly the development of new algorithmic approaches, which is a resource-intensive process.

Real-time Processing and Scalability
Challenge: Implementing a scalable architecture that can process large volumes of sensor data in real-time to provide timely predictions and alerts.
Complexity: This requires the integration of big data technologies, streaming analytics platforms, and ensuring low-latency processing. The system must also be fault-tolerant and capable of handling the variable data rates and volumes typical in maritime environments.
Reason Not Readily Solvable: Real-time data processing at scale involves significant challenges in system design, architecture, and optimization. A professional starting the project would need extensive experience in distributed systems and real-time analytics, which goes beyond typical data science skills.

Validation and Testing
Challenge: Creating a robust framework for validating and testing predictive models in real-world scenarios to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Complexity: This involves designing experiments, collecting relevant test data, and defining appropriate performance metrics. Ensuring that the models perform well in diverse operational conditions is particularly challenging.
Reason Not Readily Solvable: Had to buid a model with high precisin and high recall due to its nature. Developing a comprehensive validation and testing framework requires careful planning and extensive domain knowledge to simulate real-world conditions. It’s a complex, iterative process that cannot be readily resolved without dedicated R&D efforts.

Integration and Deployment
Challenge: Ensuring that the developed solution can be seamlessly integrated with existing vessel systems and operate effectively in the challenging maritime environment.
Complexity: This involves dealing with hardware-software integration issues, network constraints, and ensuring the robustness of the system under various environmental conditions.
Reason Not Readily Solvable: Integration challenges require deep understanding of both the maritime systems and the developed predictive models. It also involves extensive testing and validation in the field, which cannot be achieved quickly or easily by a competent professional without substantial R&D support.
